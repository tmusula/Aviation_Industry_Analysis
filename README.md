## Recommendation
The recommendation from the analysis is to focus on acquiring aircraft models with a history of zero fatalities, such as: 
SCHWEIZER SGU 2-22CK
WHITE New Standard
NANCHANG CJ-6 
NALIS GLASTAR.

The company should also prioritize models designed for commercial-grade operations over private or experimental aircraft, as they are generally subject to stricter regulatory and safety standards.
